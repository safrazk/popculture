        Popculture is the summation of ideas, perspectives, attitudes, images, and other phenomena that are within the mainstream of a given culture; especially Western culture of the early to mid 20th century and the emerging global mainstream of the late 20th and early 21st century. The content of pop culture permeates society to the point that upon hearing a few words or seeing a certain image will trigger a response even if the person is not entirely familiar with the source of the content.
        Technological functionality and aesthetics were greatly influenced by popcultural icons. Remember Flip-phones? Check out the communicators from the 60s Star Trek TV show. Tablets? Just read Ender's Game and you'll find the characters using a device that can only be described in current terms as a 'Tablet.' The video on this page shows a few inventions that were heavily influenced from pop culture scifi.</p></div>
