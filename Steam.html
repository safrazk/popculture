            <p class= "stp">OK, so steampunk may seem like a new genre, but in actuality, the influences of steam punk on technology and architecture have been around since the early 20th century. Similar to the way that the sci fi shows of the 1960s have influenced technological design and application in the current age, steam punk influenced the art deco aesthetic designs of buildings, automobiles and appliances in the early years of the 20th century. The term, "steampunk", however, is a modern designation used by enthusiasts of the community.

    Steampunk works are often set in an alternative history of the 19th century's British Victorian era or American "Wild West", in a post-apocalyptic future during which steam power has maintained mainstream usage, or in a fantasy world that similarly employs steam power. Steampunk may, therefore, be described as neo-Victorian. Steampunk perhaps most recognisably features anachronistictechnologies or retro-futuristic inventions as people in the 19th century might have envisioned them, and is likewise rooted in the era's perspective on fashion, culture, architectural style, and art.

                The genre is beginning to take hold in other media, such as music, video games and TV shows. There are even bands devoted solely to steampunk music in which the music exudes an old fashioned sound, characteristic of music of the Victorian Era along with lyrics that tell stories of airships and caravans. The visual designs of gadgets considered steampunk is being applied to modern day devices, such as ipads and smart phones.
