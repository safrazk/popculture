            <p class= "scp">Science Fiction has cemented its place in the realm of popculture since the days of Jules Verne. Many of Verne's books have been influential in directing the progress of space age technology. "From the Earth to the Moon" desribed a mechanism  used for the space travel that is quite reminiscent of the space rocket tech used by the space agencies of the present. Fast forward to the 1960s and there was a little known show named Star Trek (sarcasm intended) that began to influence the technology of today. Like Verne's rockets, star trek's word contained a variety of gadgets that have influenced modern aesthetics.

            Check out the Star Trek communicators, do they resemble a communication device prevalent in the early 2000s? What about touch screen technology? This can be found in Star Trek as well as the 1970s scifi novel, "Ender's Game". The physics of Star Trek is also being implemented in modern day science. Teleportation is being investigated and quantum researchers have succeeded in teleporting atomic particles from one area to another. Warp Theory is also being investigated as a viable means of travel to navigate the vast distances of the cosmos. </p>
