            <p class= "vgcp">Video games have forever been advancing technology in areas that one might not expect. Early video game consoles were used to develop software that led to the creation of simulations used to design automobiles, buildings and aircraft. That trend has continued today with various gaming devices used in the medical field.
The Wii has been used to help physical therapists work with patients to help regain motor control following a stroke or accident. The controller has also been used by surgeons looking to fine tune their technique. The XBOX Kinect has been modified by hospitals to help surgeons manipulate CAT scans without having to leave the sterile field.

The current trend is VR technology which is considered to be hold grail of gaming and it allows gamers to be fully absorbed into the game's world. VR, too has applications in the medical field as many psychotherapists have been using Virtual Reality to help patients suffering from various phobias. VR's application in helping train medical personnel to perform surgeries and surgical techniques is an invaluable tool in medicine and cannot be understated. </p>
